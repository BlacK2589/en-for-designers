# Case study

## Village Bojanovice - Obec Bojanovice - website

This project was my first great experience with creating websites for the municipality or city. When I got this opportunity, I did a lot of research to know how other municipal websites are doing. I found a lot of shortcomings. I'll show you some of them here. My most important task was to look for a way to simplify the website of this community as much as possible.
