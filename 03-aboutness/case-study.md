# ‚úçÔ∏è Case study

## üè† Village Bojanovice - Obec Bojanovice - website

- [üåé Full website](https://bojanovice.cz)

This project was my first great experience with creating websites for the municipality or city. When I got this opportunity, I did a lot of research to know how other municipal websites are doing. I found a lot of shortcomings. I'll show you some of them here. My most important task was to look for a way to simplify the website of this community as much as possible.

The website is made up of many things you won't find on a normal website. I focused mainly on the graphics and the overall impression of the website. One of the biggest challenges was the plugin, which is like an official board. This plugin is used so that the mayor can issue a document and after the document expires the so-called "deadline", is moved to the archive. Then there is also a plugin that is for downloading, uploading documents, of which there are always a large number of such municipalities. Then it is added to the page by a so-called shortcode. You copy it and then paste it into the page. It will create a window, a button, and a file name where people can start downloading it immediately. And to top it all off, you know how many people have downloaded it.

I also said from the beginning that the future of this site will be its simplicity and so it happened. I also had the opportunity to take a picture of the whole village with a drone, which we can see on the main page. The only thing that was a big problem is the fact that this village is divided into 3 parts, so only one was photographed, the one where the office is. Because we said that the others are not so important for this website, like the fact that people will know, yeah, here is the municipal office.

Much of the time on this site was not for implementation, but for overall preparation. Lots of options have been used to bring them as close as possible to the end-user. At the same time, one had to think about the fact that both the front end and the back end must be very simple. Because it is in the administration that the mayor can change various things with others. That's why my next idea came not to give them access to everything, as it was in the past, but only to something. Because in the past they also had access to the code and I don't consider it something that would be important to them, and especially if they changed something there, the website could crash. And that's not good at all.

I would like to thank this village, which has moved me a lot forward. I keep in touch with them and continue to manage their website. At the moment, various rules have changed again, so we had to change the website again, and unfortunately, it was not one thing, but about 20 points that had to be adjusted. Therefore, remember that municipal websites are not just done and left, but you also spend time on them after you do. She has to update so often that sometimes it occurs to me that I'm actually making a new website and they are still the same.
