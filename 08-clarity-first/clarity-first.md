## 📣Summary
Creating websites of municipalities that have their own rules that we must follow. The creation depends a lot on what we have found out from the whole research and communication with the mayors.

## 🔑 Key Points
1. Background/importance of topic: Website design has been with me for a long time and nowadays I see it as one of the big problems of community websites, which I have been focusing on for 5 years.
2. Purpose/hypothesis (thesis or statement of problem): The purpose of my work is to create a site that we will be able to use as a template for other communities.
3. Research - design/methodology/approach including procedures/data/observations: I based my research mostly on sites that I knew needed to be new. It is important to get to a modern design that is currently lacking. I also used sites that already work and I can take something from them.
4. Findings (highlight outcome of research): Creating websites for municipalities has certain rules that we must follow. We must also abide by the laws. The pages look different and are harder to find on each.
5. Conclusions (significance/success of study to theory/practical/society): Websites need to move and they need to be given a direction that everyone can go. It is best for everyone to start using similar templates and a similar style so that we all know ourselves, both in our community and in the opposite.
