# Year review 🔮

#### 🟢 SPECIAL THANKS TO OUR BEST JUSTIN! THANKS FOR THIS YEAR! 🟢

### 1. What did you like most about this subject? ⚫️

Having English and still actually doing your stuff is probably the best feeling. I was always looking for a sense of English in both middle and high school. After a long time, one gets tired of doing grammar or reading. This subject, however, was something else. It was our job, but in English. I would recommend it to everyone.

### 2. What did you like least about this subject? ⚫️

It can be something for everyone. But I say with a clear conscience that I was very satisfied and there was nothing I was not interested in. I was probably sorry that it was 3 hours and sometimes it can't be done that long.

### 3. What were the top 3 things you learned this year? ⚫️

- Github - more then Gitlab haha 😎 
- Write something about each job - let people see it 🤗
- How to make a CV in English, but actually in any language to look good 〽️

### 4. What was the most memorable activity/assignment from this year? ⚫️

Definitely my video that I created about my bachelor's thesis. Since I thought for a long time that I wouldn't make a video, but then I thought Justin would definitely appreciate it and so it happened.

### 5. What is something you accomplished this year that you are proud of? ⚫️

I’m proud of every single project that I have done this year. I learned to work with Github and Grammarly. And I’m proud of my video about my bachelor’s thesis and i’m proud about my class.

### 6. What is one thing you learned about yourself this year? ⚫️
