## 📍 Digest: Abstract

The bachelor thesis deals with the creation of websites for municipalities. The reader can get 
acquainted with the legislative requirements and the complete creation. You can also learn how 
communication with mayors or other municipal representatives takes place. We will learn the 
basic problems in the creation of these pages and why so many pages are often neglected. The 
work shows suitable solutions for clients, but also future creators of this website. It presents the 
graphic design of three websites of municipalities that served as examples. In conclusion, I tried 
to point out that this work will continue and there are certain things that we can look forward to 
in the future.
