# Storytelling

<h3>Why do you love what you do?</h3>
Doing what fulfills me is mostly a reason to enjoy it. I searched for a long time in high school. But I think at the moment I know exactly what I want to improve and what I want to do in the future. Above all, it was the worst to clarify the goals, but I like the freedom this job gives me. To be yourself and most importantly not to confess to anyone. It's a very creative job or a must have. It is especially important to approach everything professionally. And I remember that even if you don't know something, you can learn it.
