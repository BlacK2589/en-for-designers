# Storytelling 🙋🏻‍♂️

<h3>Why do you love what you do? ❤️</h3>
Doing what fulfills me is mostly a reason to enjoy it. I searched for a long time in high school. But I think at the moment I know exactly what I want to improve and what I want to do in the future. Above all, it was the worst to clarify the goals, but I like the freedom this job gives me. To be yourself and most importantly not to confess to anyone. It's a very creative job or a must-have. It is especially important to approach everything professionally. And I remember that even if you don't know something, you can learn it.<br>

Creation that depends on you is the best. See then your job that really works and see a happy client. What could be more? Then to make people enjoy the work you do?

<h3>What do you believe in? What’s your design philosophy? 💫</h3>
My design philosophy? It's been pretty hard to answer such a question lately. My main problem is that I don't really do graphics anymore. My main focus is on website and video. Then also the photos I have as my hobby. But if I have where everything comes from, I get inspired a lot from abroad and I usually think about the functionality of the site. Everything has to fit together. Your creativity can come from anywhere. All you have to do is go to nature and clear your head. Then sit down at the computer and most of the time the ideas just pile up. It's also good to look at other works, other designers, so as not to make the mistake of what others have done. Or, conversely, I'll look and say, I'll try to do it even better. It's all about your limits and you have to push them further and further.

<h3>Who inspired/inspires you? 🔎</h3>

<h4>Jan Mráz 👨🏻‍💻 - <a href="https://www.instagram.com/janm_ux/">LINK</a></h4>

- He is a very good UX and UI designer who adds something new and enriches me every day. The main reason why I started watching him is that he is Czech and adds everything in English. Which is unprecedented nowadays for someone to create in a language other than their native language. Our company goes the same way, so I'm just glad to see someone else.

<h4>Full Time Filmmaker 🎥 - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/ParkerWalbeck">LINK</a></h4>

- This is the best production I've found in the last few months. Making videos became very important to me in 2020, and I've been in it ever since. This project is great for its uniqueness. A few months ago, I bought their courses, which I can't get enough of, and now and then I'm playing some more and more videos from them that could bring me closer to success in such a field. They add the motivation and knowledge one needs and it's something extra.

<h3>Where does your inspiration come from? ✍🏻</h3>

My inspiration in design is mostly that I try to look for things similar to what I would like to do. Then I'll tell you, this is a good foundation, but something is missing. Inspiration, but it can be anything, your friend, family, or a walk. Nowadays, you see design everywhere you look. I mostly put my work into creating websites. There are many things and trends that have changed a lot lately and you still have to be in the picture. Once they are things that are rounded and once they are square.

When it comes to videos, I take inspiration where I can. I'll mostly figure out how I want the video to look. I'll shoot everything I need. The more shots the better, because the worst thing that can happen to you is that you won't have enough shots. Then everything for me is always done according to the music. I have transitioned as the footage goes, it's all based on the music, and I always try to make the video make sense and everyone finds it.
